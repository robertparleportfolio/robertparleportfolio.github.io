            <h2>My third year dissertation</h2>
            <p>This page contains some of the work that I have been working on relevant to my disseration that I have been completing
            as part of my third year modules. The disseration has been worked on since last summer and focuses on JavaScript, HTML and CSS. </p><br>
            <h2>Accessibility Simulation</h2>
            <p>This dissertation aims to provide a tool that developers can use to help them developer websites that are usable for people will all disabilities. I chosen
            this type of disseratation as it interests me, I feel there is alot of work that needs to be done in this area, while also using the technologies that I would
            like to work with in the future, i.e HTML, CSS and JavaScript </p><br>
            <h2>Poster presentation</h2>
            <p>One of the submissions for this dissertation module required a poster presentation, this involved me talking about the poster (shown on this page) and discussing
            the subject area to my peers. Why I felt this project is relevant and why it should be worked on, and how specifically I am working on it.  </p><br>
