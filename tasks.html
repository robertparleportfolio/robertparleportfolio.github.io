            <p class="col-md-8">The small task involved writing some JavaScript that could take values inputted from the user and then output a URL based off what they entered. For example
            if a user entered in their channel and progamme ID into the input fields and hit submit. The correct URL for them would be printed onto their screen via a string for them to copy
            from.

            <h2 class="col-md-12">Developing this portfolio website</h2>
            <p class="col-md-8">When developing the website, it was decided to use a User Centered Design approach, this way I would be able to cater for all the possible users of this website.
            It began with creating some user personas and use cases so that I could decide what needed to be on the website for it to be useable. Then I drew some low and medium fidelity protoypes
            to get some of my ideas from my mind onto paper. This way when it came to coding, I already had some visual ideas down to work from.
